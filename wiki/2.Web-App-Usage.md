### Starred

### Drafts
Whenever you click the X button to close the Compose window without sending, your current email is automatically saved as a draft.  
These drafts can be found in the Drafts folder, where you can open, edit, and send them later.  
This ensures you never lose unsent work and can continue composing at any time.

### Spam
Emails can be marked as Spam using the “Mark as Spam” button.  
When an email is sent to the Spam folder, **all URLs** found in its content are automatically added to the **blacklist**.  
 If no URLs are found, **the sender’s email address** is blacklisted instead.  
any incoming email containing a URL that already exists in the blacklist is automatically moved to the Spam folder, ensuring protection against known malicious links.
You can also mark emails as not Spam. When doing so, the related URLs or sender are **removed** from the blacklist to allow future messages through.

### Trash
Emails can be moved to the Trash using the “Move to Trash” button.  
Once in the Trash folder, messages are no longer visible in their original folders.  
Users can permanently delete these emails or restore them back to their original folder (Inbox or Sent).  
This provides a way to manage deletions safely, allowing recovery of accidentally deleted messages.
