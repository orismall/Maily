## Run the web app
 To use the Gmail-like Android application, run it on an emulator or physical device using Android Studio.  
Ensure that **Docker-compose** is running, and that the API base URL (configured in the `string.xml` file) points to `http://10.0.2.2:<WEB_PORT>/api/` when using an emulator.   
By default this is set to : `http://10.0.2.2:5001/api/`

### Folders Overview
-	**Inbox** - Displays all received emails that are not marked as Spam or moved to Trash
-	**Sent** - Contains all emails the user has sent
-	**Starred** - Displays emails marked as important with a star
-	**Drafts** - Unsaved emails are automatically stored here when the Compose window is closed without sending. Drafts can be edited and sent later.

- **Spam** -  
Emails can be marked as Spam using the “Mark as Spam” button.  
When an email is sent to the Spam folder, **all URLs** found in its content are automatically added to the **blacklist**.  
If no URLs are found, **the sender’s email address** is blacklisted instead.  
any incoming email containing a URL that already exists in the blacklist is automatically moved to the Spam folder, ensuring protection against known malicious links.  
You can also mark emails as not Spam. When doing so, the related URLs or sender are **removed** from the blacklist to allow future messages through.

- **Trash** -  
Emails can be moved to the Trash using the “Move to Trash” button.  
Once in the Trash folder, messages are no longer visible in their original folders.  
Users can permanently delete these emails or restore them back to their original folder (Inbox or Sent).  
This provides a way to manage deletions safely, allowing recovery of accidentally deleted messages.

## Refresh mails
The Refresh button updates the current mail list for the selected folder (Inbox, Starred, Trash, etc.).  
When clicked, the application fetches the latest data from the server and displays the most up-to-date state of your emails.
