## How to Build & Run

### Requirements
- Docker, Android studio and MongoDB installed on your machine

### Build full application with Docker-compose:
The full app can be built using a single command:  
```docker-compose up --build```  

By default, Docker Compose uses environment variables from the `.env` file located in the same directory.  
This file defines the following settings:  

**SERVER_PORT** = 12345  
**BITS_ARRAY_SIZE** = 16  
**HASH_FUNCS** = "1 2"  
**WEB_PORT** = 5001  
**WEB_CLIENT_PORT** = 3000  

You can override any of these variables at runtime using the command line:
```
WEB_CLIENT_PORT=<Web_Client_Port> \
WEB_PORT=<Web_Port> \
SERVER_PORT=<Server_Port> \
BITS_ARRAY_SIZE=<Bits_Array_Size> \
HASH_FUNCS="<Hash_Functions>" \
docker-compose up --build
```
Just make sure you enter valid arguments.       
- Note: If you change the WEB_PORT  , you must also update the value in the `.env` file located in the `web-client` folder, and the `BaseUrl` String located in the `Strings.xml` file.

To stop the app and exit, press `Ctrl + C`.
